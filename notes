# Section 01_01: Inversion of Control Pattern
Spring is an open-source framework for Java applications that provides dependency injection of Spring Beans via 
Spring application context, which follows the inversion-of-control desing pattern.

Dependency Injection (DI) Principle
- Separates the usage of objects from the lifecycle of their dependent objects
- Creation of the dependencies of a class is managed outside the class
- Makes application more flexible and maintainable and easier to test 

Inversion-of-Control Framework
- Maintains lifecycle of an object and its dependencies
- Requires dependency injection
- Class "relinquishes control" to the framework

Spring Context
- Also known as spring container
-The core Spring inversion-of-control framework

Spring Bean
- Java object managed by the Spring application context
- Singleton scope by default
- Other scopes: prototype, request, session

DI Configuration
- Originally via XML files: difficult to manage
- Java classes:
  - Annotated method: @Bean method within an @Configuration class
  - Annotated class such as @Component, @Service, @Repository

# Section 01_02: Spring ApplicationContext and Spring Beans
- A SprinBeans class was created, defining the different Beans (repository, tourManagement and TravelAgent).
  This is the configuration for the dependency injection.

- A context was then loaded with the Spring Beans class in the main application: 
  "ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SpringBeans.class);"

- Instantiation of TravelAgentService object was performed from the context Bean:
  "TravelAgentService agent = context.getBean(TravelAgentService.class);"

# Section 01_03: Spring autowiring annotations
- Another way to configure dependency injection is with autowiring

- For using the autowire functionality for DI, we need to annotate the different class layers:
- - Repository with @Repository
- - Services with @Service

- With these annotations we do not need the spring beans class that instantiates the class objects with explicit dependencies

- Since the spring beans class is removed, we need to adapt the instantiation of the context in the application:
"ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SpringBeans.class);"
                                           |
                                           V
"ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(Application.class.getPackageName());"
